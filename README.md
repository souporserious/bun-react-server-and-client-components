# Bun React Server and Client Components

This is a minimal example of using React Server and Client components using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) based on [simple-rsc](https://github.com/bholmesdev/simple-rsc) by [bholmesdev](https://x.com/bholmesdev).

## Development

First, [install bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun start
```

You can now view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
